# A hotel management system I made in school

## Introduction and summary
<p>
  I made this little project during my education and it's a hotel management system that utilizes a database in MySQL. It contains a login form from which it opens into
  the actual program. In the program there are:

  - A login form
  - A main window to navigate into other sections
  - A customer window to manage customers
  - A room window to manage rooms
  - A reservation window to manage reservations
</p>
<p>
  I'm adding this here in a new repository with English comments on the code and slight adjustments. Otherwise this is in the same state as it was when I finished it
  back in school.
